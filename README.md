# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.  
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.  
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

# The Analysis
Each query in this project targeted a specific aspect of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached the first question:

### **Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs**
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered job postings by average yearly salary and location. This query helped highlight where the most lucrative opportunities are for data analysts.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
